Chat client written in python that uses the web API.

THIS PROGRAM IS NOT COMPLETED AND DOES NOT DO MUCH YET.

This project helped a bit:
https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/blob/master/SteamTrade/SteamWeb.cs

What works:
* Login
 * steam guard (cookies are stored so this only needs to be done once)
 * captcha (when the password was entered wrong too often)
* Getting the friendlist and displaying it in a GUI

TODO:
Everything else like
* Polling the presence status https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamWebUserPresenceOAuth/Poll/.....
* Actual Chat
* etc.
* Clean up
* Pidgin Plugin (to replace (sometimes) unreliable mobile api based plugin)

Works only on linux so far (probably)

Requirements:
* python3
* pyqt5
* python-xdg (for getting the user data dir to store the cookies)
* python-crypto (for rsa encrypting the password)

Building:
pyuic5 steamchat-webapi.ui -o ui_steamchat_webapi.py
./steamchat.py
